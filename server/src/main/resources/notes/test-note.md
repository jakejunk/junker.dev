# Header 1 - This is a test note

If you're reading this, congrats on the peek behind the curtain.

## Header 2
This is a paragraph.
This is part of the same paragraph.

This is a new paragraph.

This should be *emphasized*.

This should be **bold**.

This should be ~~struck through~~.

This is a list:
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
    - Subitem 1
    - Subitem 2
      - Too much

This is a line after a list.
This is a link: [Go to Google](https://google.com).
This is a link with formatting: [_**Go to Google**_](https://google.com).
This is a link with no text: [](/).
This should be regular text: www.google.com.

This has a span of `code`. I'll keep typing so that a new line breaks at some point
and then before you know it yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada `BAM` another inline code span.

```kotlin
// This comment is wayyyy too long ============================================================================================================================================================================
fun test() {
    println("Cool! This line is really long for testing!")
}
```

```kotlin
// This is some Kotlin code
fun test() {
    val int = 1
    val double = 1.0
    val float = 1.0f
    val fontSize = 1.rem
    
    println("Neat!")
}
```
